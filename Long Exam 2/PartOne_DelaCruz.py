1. Procedural programming involves a certain procedure or flow that may have the tendency to be redundant 
and take too much space for a code. However in Object-Oriented Programming, it reduces the storage and 
avoids redundancy. For example, in Procedural Programming, it follows only from top to bottom. You cannot
call a procedure on its own. Think of it like an ordinal set of values, it goes only on one linear direction.
The difference with Object-Oriented Programming, is the opposite. It can go from one procedure to another
regardless of its sequence. You can call something found at the beginning while you are the end of your code.

2. GUI is short for Graphic User Interface. It is helpful in creating programs and applications since it is
presented to us in a visual manner. There are text, boxes, colors, buttons, images, and etc. It helps, in
a sense, in making the code come to reality. It makes it accessible and easier to navigate. Who would rather 
prefer just plain texts and boring colors right? Of course it has value as a set of programmed language, but 
maybe for programmers it is fun and enjoyable but for an ordinary person, they want to be entertained and
they want things to be easy. And GUI provides just that. Moreover, specifically in geomatics, it helps us 
visualize more the problems we are solving. For example, the app project we are making is about a traverse plotter.
Students have a difficult time visualizing the plot of traverse but using programming and with GUI, we can help
make things easier.

3. Operation Overloading is using operations to overload a function. It is redefining a code using an operation.
For example to overload the print function wit certain texts, or to oveload the + operator with to return a certain
set of text.

4.Inheritance is having a superclass and then a derived class from it. It follows the attributes it has. 
One good example is inherting from our parents. Using code, we can do this by making a class named Parents
then another Child. And the child can get characteristics from the Parent such as money, looks, etc.

5. Front-end is what the users see. The Back-end is the one who makes the output. And Database it the storage for
that output. For example in the production of goods. The commercials, posters, and promotions with the models and 
celebrities represents the front-end. It is what the buyers see. The Back-end are the manufacturers, the factory
 workers, who create the  product or goods, say a shampoo. Then these products are stored in either a warehouse
 or shelves that serve as the database.
