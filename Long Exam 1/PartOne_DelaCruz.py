1. Procedural Programming is the use of structures such as repetition, sequence, and selection.
It follows a certain procedure. However, in Functional Programing, functions are used. The coder can create
her own set of formula inside the function and call it whenever she needs instead of writing everything over
and over.

2. Git Hub is a very useful tool. It has features such as pushing and pulling codes. 
This is very helpful when working or collaborating as a team. 
One could easily push their code to another person and also pull a code from another person.

3. While Loops are used when you do not know how many times the code should repeat. 
For instance, in levelling, one does not know how many lines there will be before the loop is closed or finished, 
the surveyor can add as many as they want.
For Loops, however, set a limit to how many times the code will repeat itself. 
For example, in traverse, the user can put how many lines there is and it will continue looping until it reaches
the specified lines there is.

4. The Divide and Conquer Paradigm in programming is a method of breaking down the code so that 
it will be more simple and manageable to code. This mainly uses functions. Functions are very effective
in making a code simple and manageable because it lessens the need to write everything again.

5. Azimuth(from North or South) to Bearing and vice versa.
This one is a simple code but can be a lot of help to a GE. It is a basic and fundamental function. 
Not all Total Station use the same Azimuth, some use from the North and others the south. 
I would first ask the user to tell if what kind his or her input would be. Whether it is az from north, from south 
or bearing. Then I would make functions with the related formula for each. For example, if it says azimuth from north
, it will call the function for the formula of azimuth from north to bearing.
